                    <h2>Aim of the Project</h2>
                    <p>One of the key missions of the United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COPs) is to achieve inclusive climate action worldwide. Therefore, the main aim of this project is to analyse the inclusivity of COP events over time by constructing various graphs and visualisations. Inclusivity is assessed based on such metrics as participant diversity, regional representation distribution, and the involvement of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Through an analysis of attendance trends, participant categories, regional hosting dynamics, observer NGO involvement, and global CO₂ emissions, this report aims to shed light on the evolution of COP events, which significant resources are spent on, and their role in fostering inclusive global dialogue on climate action.

                    <h2>Analytical Challenges</h2>
                    <p>For this analysis, it was not possible to create charts that automatically update because there were no particular API sources in this topic. While the topic concerns an important issue – reaching inclusivity in climate action – worldwide, the main data sources and databases belong to the UNFCCC and individual COP hosting states that do not produce APIs. Although it was possible to find some API sources for particular parties, such as in the case of the UK, it was not feasible to present a whole analysis of the UNFCCC and COP parties as a whole. Therefore, I mainly used CSV files for my data analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another challenge was related to categorical overlap in participating categories. The main aim of this project was to analyse the inclusivity in COP events and, therefore, the participation of NGOs was the primary target of analysis. However, some participants belonged to multiple categories which complicated the classification of participant categories. For instance, academic affiliations were shown both in academic and NGO classification in some contexts.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The project summarises the complex relationship between inclusivity in climate transition and the global response to climate change. It reveals a notable increase in NGO involvement over the years as observer organisations to the UNFCCC process, which voices the increased efforts to address diverse and marginalised groups in the global climate dialogue. Nonetheless, the constant increase in annual CO₂ emissions worldwide alarms us of an urgent risk of a failure to cultivate inclusive representation with tangible climate outcomes.
                    </p>While inclusivity is a key mission of the COP and global climate conversation in order to protect the Indigenous and marginalised populations worldwide from climate threats, these efforts have to be coupled with tangible commitments and practical implementation so that the consequences of climate change do not endanger life in the world. As a result, these visualisations call on humanity to work harder in order to address the risks of climate change and achieve global justice where no resources are wasted and no life is threatened.
