            <h2>Week 1: A basic chart</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The chart shows a relationship between GDP per capita (PPP) and life expectancy for different countries across various regions.
                The X-axis represents the GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP), meaning it adjusts for price level differences across countries.
                The scale is logarithmic, so it increases more rapidly as you move to the right. The Y-axis represents the life expectancy at birth in years.
                The chart shows a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy, indicating that as GDP per capita increases, life expectancy tends to rise.
                Countries with lower GDP tend to have shorter life expectancies, while those with higher GDPs tend to have longer life expectancies.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This chart shows the projected cumulative percentage change in population for several South Korea, Japan, the UK, Italy, Spain, France, and the US from 2020 to 2100, according to UN data.
                It highlights population decline trends, with countries like South Korea and Japan expected to experience the most significant population decreases, while countries like the US are projected to have moderate population growth.
                South Korea is projected to have a sharp population decline, reaching around -0.45 by 2100. Japan also shows a significant decline, though less steep than South Korea. The UK, Italy, and Spain show steady declines, with Italy declining slightly more.
                France remains relatively stable, showing a minimal decline. The US is projected to have population growth, with an increase of about 0.3 by the end of the century.
                This chart underscores how certain countries are facing severe demographic challenges related to aging populations and declining birth rates, while others are projected to grow.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This chart shows the relationship between the sugar intensity (grams of sugar per 100 grams of product) and two variables.
                Firstly, number of products (represented by pink bars on the left y-axis). This indicates how many products fall within specific ranges of sugar intensity.
                Most products have a sugar intensity between 4 and 10 grams per 100 grams, with a peak around 5 grams. Secondly, tax rate (depicted by the green line on the right y-axis).
                This shows the tax (in pence per gram of sugar) associated with each sugar intensity level. As sugar intensity increases, the tax per gram of sugar decreases.
                The chart suggests that products with higher sugar intensity have a lower tax per gram of sugar, while a greater number of products fall within the mid-range of sugar intensity.

                This chart shows the relationship between gun deaths and income across US states, with several variables encoded visually.
                The X-axis represents the median income of US states while the Y-axis shows firearm deaths per 100,000 population.
                The colours indicate the Gini coefficient (a measure of income inequality), with a scale from 0.42 (low inequality) to 0.48 (high inequality).
                The chart highlights how income, gun deaths, inequality, region, and prison rates vary across US states. For instance, states with higher median incomes appear to have lower gun death rates, while some states with high Gini coefficients tend to have higher gun deaths.
                The regional distinctions (Midwest, Northeast, South, West) may show trends based on geography.

                The chart depicts the growth of renewable energy output in Germany from the 1970s to 2020. The data is presented in gigawatt-hours (GWh), with the source noted as "IEA via ECO-API."
                The green bars show a relatively flat output until the mid-1990s, followed by a significant increase in renewable energy production, peaking around 2020.
                This chart highlights Germany's growing focus on renewable energy over the past few decades, with a sharp rise in output, particularly from the early 2000s onwards, reflecting the country's commitment to cleaner energy sources.

                This chart displays "Vice Spending," showing the trends in spending on alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics over time in the UK, using data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
                The categories tracked include beer, narcotics, spirits, tobacco, and wines, cider and perry. The graph reveals patterns in how people have allocated their spending on these items over the years.
