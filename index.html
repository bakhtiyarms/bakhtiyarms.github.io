                This chart shows the relationship between gun deaths and income across US states, with several variables encoded visually.
                The X-axis represents the median income of US states while the Y-axis shows firearm deaths per 100,000 population.
                The colours indicate the Gini coefficient (a measure of income inequality), with a scale from 0.42 (low inequality) to 0.48 (high inequality).
                The chart highlights how income, gun deaths, inequality, region, and prison rates vary across US states. For instance, states with higher median incomes appear to have lower gun death rates, while some states with high Gini coefficients tend to have higher gun deaths.
                The regional distinctions (Midwest, Northeast, South, West) may show trends based on geography.

                The chart depicts the growth of renewable energy output in Germany from the 1970s to 2020. The data is presented in gigawatt-hours (GWh), with the source noted as "IEA via ECO-API."
                The green bars show a relatively flat output until the mid-1990s, followed by a significant increase in renewable energy production, peaking around 2020.
                This chart highlights Germany's growing focus on renewable energy over the past few decades, with a sharp rise in output, particularly from the early 2000s onwards, reflecting the country's commitment to cleaner energy sources.

                This chart displays "Vice Spending," showing the trends in spending on alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics over time in the UK, using data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
                The categories tracked include beer, narcotics, spirits, tobacco, and wines, cider and perry. The graph reveals patterns in how people have allocated their spending on these items over the years.
